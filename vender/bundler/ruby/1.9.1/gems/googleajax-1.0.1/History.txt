=== 1.0.0 / 2009-12-17

* Incompatible changes:
  * Returns Hashes instead of OpenStruct by default (require googleajax/as_open_struct if you need OpenStruct)
  * Indices are symbols with underscores instead of camelcased string, (e.g. :estimated_count instead of "estimatedCount")
  * Values are converted automatically for Floats, Integers and true and false.

* translate accepts :english, :french, etc... as source or destination languages in addition to the language codes

* Much more flexible structure.

=== 0.2.0 / 2009-11-17

* New features:
  * results can use [] and []= for lookup and seting
  * allows results to be open structs (default) or hash (by requiring 'googleajax/as_hash' instead)

* bug fixes:
  * Search.web(...).count now returns an int, not a string
  * many calls were not passing the args argument to #get
  * Feed.load used to return an open struct with only one method called 'feed' that was a hash. It now returns the feed correctly.

* Behind the scene changes:
  * specs
  * shorter, cleaner code
  * links to google api doc in rdoc
  * most classes are now modules
  * small optimizations
  * All #get now requires arg (see bug fix)

=== 0.1.0 / 2008-05-19

* Initial Release
